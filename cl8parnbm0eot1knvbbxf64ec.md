## So I really begin writing

# Who am I?

I am a developer. Backend, to be specific. Earlier also used to do AI dev. I dabbled with frontend but gave up midway. I work at a health-tech at the moment, developing their features and cloud resources.

I was always interested in tech, since school days. Not just coding, but how it works, behind the scenes. I started with Basic, moved on to HTML, CSS, JS and then real coding. C/C++ was in the curriculum, but I learnt Python just by doing, i.e. no formal courses. And now that's my most used language. That's why I strongly believe in the power of self-taught skills.

Oh, I'm also a college student. That's part of the problem though. I stay so busy with academics, work and the tens of other things I'm always involved in, it becomes hard to find time for self improvement.

# It started with admiration

I started following more and more indie-hackers on Twitter, started reading an increasing number of news articles on emerging tech like blockchains, web3, etc. I was amazed by the community. People hacking their way for fun, while I am postponing learning for tomorrow. Took me back to my time in high school when I kept making small side projects for fun.

I miss those days. Felt like, after college started, my personal or technical development kind of paused. So this blog is an attempt to restart just that.

# You may ask how

And I am here to answer that. This blog is for documenting what I do from now on. I have a huge wishlist of stuff, like:

- Start contributing to open source
- Do a bunch of side projects either for fun or to solve some problem
- Deep dive into the libraries I use daily, how they work under the hood
- Experiment with code I just discovered on GitHub

This blog will be my accounting tool. I will be writing about what I do and what I learn. Can be either what I contributed to OSS, what new things I discovered while `ctrl + clicking` function names on VS Code, or just analysis I did on some DS assignment.

# Playing brain games with myself

This is me trying to gamify my learning. I really don't have a good track record on sticking with things. This can either turn into my habit, or another abandoned project. Only time can tell (wish me luck).
